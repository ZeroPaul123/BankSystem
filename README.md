Hey ther thanks for checking out my project. This is one of the first projects i made in php and i put quite much time into it, so i decided to publish it. Also i know the code is really messy in some parts, but this was bascially just to learn and nothing besides one weird foreach loop is copied. I learned alot of stuff but i wont bother to clean up this old code.
